Chris Soteros is a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Saskatchewan
and the PIMS Site Director for the University of Saskatchewan site. Her research
involves mathematical models of chemical and biological systems with a  focus on
understanding polymers (long chain molecules) in solution.  She uses
coarse-grained lattice models to represent the possible shapes or configurations
that the polymers can take and often studies questions about the probability of
knots or links with applications to understanding DNA topology experiments.

Her
research involves the folding and packing behavior of DNA, proteins, and other
string-like biomolecules, and the knot theory of random space curves.
