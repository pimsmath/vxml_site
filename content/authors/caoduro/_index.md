I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at UBC Sauder, working under the guidance of
[Joseph Paat](https://sites.google.com/site/josephspaat/) and [Bruce
Shepherd](https://bshepherd.ca/). My research focuses on the combinatorial
properties of geometric objects, as well as linear and integer programming,
graph theory, and discrete geometry.

I recently completed my PhD studies at Université Grenoble Alpes, where I was
supervised by [András Sebő](https://pagesperso.g-scop.grenoble-inp.fr/~seboa/)
and [Matěj Stehlík](https://www.irif.fr/en/users/matej/index). During my time
there, I developed a keen interest in exploring the mathematical structures of
geometric intersection graphs, which has become a central theme in my research.
