Mahsa is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Manitoba. Her research is 
centred around using graph theory to answer questions that arise in design
theory. In particular, her main PhD research was on the extensions of the famous
Erd≈ës-Ko-Rado theorem to t-intersecting families of perfect matchings in graphs.
She is Also interested in Matrix theory and linear algebra, and has a background
in Numerical Analysis.
