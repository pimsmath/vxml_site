Alex Weekes is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and
Statistics at the University of Saskatchewan. His research is in pure
mathematics, and focuses on representation theory, algebra, algebraic geometry,
and mathematical physics.  You can find more information on his [Research
page](https://researchers.usask.ca/alex-weekes/research.php).

He completed my PhD in 2016 at the University of Toronto, under the supervision
of [Joel Kamnitzer](https://www.math.toronto.edu/jkamnitz/).  I was a
postdoctoral researcher at the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical
Physics](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/) from 2016-2019, where my mentor was
[Alexander Braverman](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/people/alexander-braverman).
From 2019-2021 I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of British
Columbia](https://www.math.ubc.ca/), under [Kai
Behrend](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~behrend/), [Jim
Bryan](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~jbryan/), and [Sabin
Cautis](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cautis/).  He joined the Department of
Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Saskatchewan in July 2021.
