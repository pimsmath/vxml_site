Curtis Wendlandt am a representation theorist studying quantum groups, quantum
symmetric pairs, Kac-Moody and toroidal Lie algebras, and their generalizations.
More information about my research can be found on his [research
page](https://researchers.usask.ca/curtis-wendlandt/research.php).

Curtis completed his PhD under the supervision of [Nicolas
Guay](https://ualberta.ca/~nguay) at the University of
Alberta in June 2019. From August 2019 to June 2021 he was a Zassenhaus Assistant
Professor and NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow at The Ohio State University, where his
mentor was [Sachin Gautam](https://people.math.osu.edu/gautam.42/). He joined the Department of Mathematics and Statistics
at the University of Saskatchewan in July 2021.
