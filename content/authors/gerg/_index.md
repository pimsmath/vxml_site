Greg Martin (he/him/his) obtained a BSc in Mathematics from Stanford University
and a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Michigan in 1997, and was a
Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study and the University of
Toronto. He is currently a Professor in the UBC Mathematics Department.

His research interests include analytic number theory, typically problems
stemming from classical multiplicative number theory using complex analytic and
"anatomy of integers" techniques. He is also interested in understanding,
engaging with, and improving equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) at UBC and
beyond, and he is a member and former Chair of the Mathematics Departmentâ€™s EDI
Committee.

He is a two-time winner of the MAA's Lester R. Ford Award and a winner of a UBC
Faculty of Science Killam Teaching Prize.
