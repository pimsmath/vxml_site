Clifton Cunningham is a professor of mathematics at the University of Calgary.
His current research in the Langlands Program focuses on three projects: the
Voganish Project; automorphic representations of GSpin attached to Abelian
varieties; and geometrization of various parts of the Langlands Correspondence.
Information about these projects and my small army of collaborators may be found
at automorphic.ca.
