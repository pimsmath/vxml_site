  due **Friday, April 14th**.
{{< /alert >}}


At the end each iteration of the VXML program, the undergraduate participants
should complete a poster, a written report, and give a talk about their
VXML project. The talk will be given to the other VXML participants at a "Wrap
Up" meeting to be held in early April. Details of each of these requirements can
be found below.

## Talk
At the "Wrap-Up" meeting, each group will be asked to give a 10 minute talk on
their work.  There will be 2-3 minutes after each talk for questions. The talk
should be aimed at a general audience. It should introduce your project then
cover the details of what you worked on and accomplished. The presentations
should be given by the undergraduate members of your group and, ideally, each
member of the group should have an opportunity to speak. We recommend practicing
within your group _before_ the Wrap-Up meeting.


## Poster
Each group should produce a poster about their VXML project. It should give a
brief description of the project, followed by highlights the work you completed,
details of challenges you faced, and techniques you used. If possible, it
should include any visualizations which are relevant to your project.  Finally,
it should indicate any possible directions for future research. The visual
design of the poster is up to you, so be as creative as you want! The content
from the poster will be used to update the project descriptions on the VXML
website.


## Final Report

Each group should collaborate to write a final report as a permanent record of
what they did during their VXML project.  A final (PDF) version will be linked
to your project on the VXML website.  Ideally the report should be written in
either [MarkDown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) or
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) format. [LaTeX and Markdown
templates](./final-report-templates.zip) are available to help you format your
report.  The report should be 3 or more pages in length and should be written in
the style of a scientific article.
