Beginning in the 2024-2025 academic year, PIMS is working toward supporting more
in-person programs at its member sites, so will be transitioning the VXML
program to a program providing support to these local XML activities. Calls for
new XML projects at these sites will be conducted locally. Students wishing to
participate in a local XML should visit the XML at their PIMS site (see below).
