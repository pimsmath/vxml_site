If you'd like to get involved with the VXML, please find the relevant
section below and get in touch. We anticipate supporting 4-5 projects each year
with each project consisting of a faculty member or postdoc, a graduate mentor
and 2-4 undergraduates.


### Get involved as... an Undergraduate
PIMS VXML is all about getting undergraduate students involved in research
mathematics. Motivated students will work with leading researchers on exciting
projects and perform cutting edge mathematical research.

PIMS VXML is open to undergraduate students at any of the <a
href="https://pims.math.ca/">PIMS Member or Affiliate Member Universities</a>.
You must be prepared to commit around 6-8 hours per week working on the
project and meeting with the other members of your project team. When applying
you'll be asked to tell us about your mathematical interests and pick from a
list of potential projects.

Upon completion, undergraduate team members will receive a certificate from PIMS
attesting to their participation in undergraduate research in the mathematical
sciences via the VXML.

Student applications are now open and will close on **November 5th**. Full
project descriptions will be available on this site shortly.


### Get involved as... a Graduate Student Mentor

Graduate students mentors work closely with their faculty lead and the
undergraduate students, providing an anchor for the project. You must be a
graduate student at a PIMS member (or affiliate member) university and you must
be in at least your second year. You should expect to commit 6-8 hours per week
to the project, including team meetings.

Graduate student mentors will receive a modest ($500 CAD) stipend, for their
participation.

Project submissions are now open soon and will close on **November 5th**. Full
project descriptions will be available on this site shortly.

### Get involved as... a Faculty Member or Postdoc
Any faculty member or postdoctoral researcher at a PIMS Member or Affiliate
Member University can propose projects for the VXML program.  From prior
experience, successful projects usually have some computational element that
students get into while learning the relevant background, and have achievable
intermediate goals.

The projects will be advertised to students on this website and should include
details on the areas of mathematical interest and any prerequisites they have.
We also ask that each project sponsor nominate a graduate student to help bridge
the gap between research and undergraduate.

If you have an idea for a project please complete the project proposal form to
get the process started.  Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have
questions about proposing a project.
