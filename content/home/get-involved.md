Beginning in the 2024-2025 academic year, PIMS is working toward supporting more
in-person programs at its member sites, so will be transitioning the VXML
program to a program providing support to these local XML activities. Calls for
new XML projects at these sites will be conducted locally. Students wishing to
participate in a local XML should visit the the XML at their PIMS site below.

  * [MXML at the University of
    Manitoba <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>](https://sites.google.com/view/mxml/home)
  * [QuantTA at the University of
    Saskatchewan <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>](https://artsandscience.usask.ca/quanta/)


PIMS also hopes to expand this list of local XML sites as the program grows. In
addition to financial support for stipends and lab events etc., PIMS can offer
administrative support by sharing draft project solicitation and application
forms, and consultation on best practices for creating a new XML. If you are a
faculty member at a [PIMS member
institution <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>](https://www.pims.math.ca/pims-sites) and are considering setting up
a new XML, please see below for more details and [contact
us](#contact) if you would like to apply.

### XML Coordinator Responsibilities
As an XML lab coordinator, you will be responsible for soliciting and selecting
new XML projects from postdocs at your site each year. This is typically done in
the weeks before the start of the fall term, so that you can start advertising
the selected projects to undergraduate students at the beginning of term.

Once students start applying, you will need to assign them to projects, matching
their skills and attributes with the needs of the project to build effective
teams. Next you will need to arrange a kick off meeting three or four weeks into
the term, to set expectations for all participants and to connect the groups
with any resources you can offer them (e.g. computational resources).

Throughout the term, you should stay in close contact with the project mentors
to help them address any challenges they are facing and to make sure they have
realistic goals and a good chance of achieving them. You may wish to organize
periodic check-in meetings to stay on top of this.

Two or three months before the end of the academic year, you should contact all
of the project members to arrange a wrap-up meeting. This meeting is typically
held at the end of the term, and can be tricky to schedule with the exams and
other responsibilities the students have. At the wrap up meeting, students
should present their work to all of the XML members for feedback. Finally, a
written report should be prepared by the students a few weeks after the end of
term.
