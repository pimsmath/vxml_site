Beginning in the 2024-2025 academic year, PIMS is working toward supporting more
in-person programs at its member sites, so will be transitioning the VXML
program to a program providing support to these local XML activities. Calls for
new XML projects at these sites will be conducted locally. Students wishing to
participate in a local XML should visit the the XML at their PIMS site below.

  * [WXML at the University of Washington <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>](https://wxml.math.washington.edu/)
  * [MXML at the University of Manitoba <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>](https://sites.google.com/view/mxml/home)
  * [QuantTA at the University of Saskatchewan <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>](https://artsandscience.usask.ca/quanta/)

PIMS also hopes to expand this list of local XML sites and can offer, in
addition to financial support for stipends and lab events, administrative
support by sharing draft project solicitation and application forms, and
consultation on best practices for XMLs.


### How it works...

Research problems are proposed by a faculty member or postdoc at a PIMS member
(or affilate member) university, and a project team consisting of the mentor, a
graduate student and 2-4 undergraduate students are formed to work on the
problem.  Teams commit 6-8 hours per week to work on the project and to meet to
discuss their discoveries. Students will use a mixture of computational tools
such as [CoCalc (Sage Math Cloud)](https://cocalc.com/) or Jupyter, to work and
collaborate with each other.

At the end of the year there is an open-house event where discoveries can be
showcased and any results presented. Finally, a written report is prepared by
the project members as a record of their work.


#### The Axioms of XML
The VXML strongly believes in [Federico Ardila-Mantillaâ€™s
axioms <i class="fa-solid fa-file-pdf"></i>](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/Articles/noticesfinal.pdf):

  * **Axiom 1**: Mathematical talent is distributed equally among different
    groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
  * **Axiom 2**: Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering
    mathematical experiences.
  * **Axiom 3**: Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped
    and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
  * **Axiom 4**: Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
