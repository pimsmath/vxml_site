XML projects consist of a research project proposed by a faculty member and a
team made up of the faculty member, a graduate student mentor and a small group
of undergraduate students. These teams work together over the course of the
academic year to tackle the problem, typically using a mixture of computational
tools such as CoCalc or Jupyter.

To get involved with the XML program, please select one of the local sites
below. Each XML organizes it's own call for projects and participants so
deadlines may vary.

  * [MXML at the University of Manitoba <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>](https://sites.google.com/view/mxml/home)
  * [QuantTA at the University of Saskatchewan <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>](https://artsandscience.usask.ca/quanta/)

PIMS is currently working to expand this list of local XML sites. If you are a
faculty member at a PIMS Member Institution who is interested in setting up a
new XML, please see the see the [get involved](#get-involved) section for more
information about how PIMS can help you get started.


### How it works...

Research problems are proposed by a faculty member or postdoc at a PIMS member
(or affilate member) university, and a project team consisting of the mentor, a
graduate student and 2-4 undergraduate students are formed to work on the
problem.  Teams commit 6-8 hours per week to work on the project and to meet to
discuss their discoveries. Students will use a mixture of computational tools
such as [CoCalc (Sage Math Cloud)](https://cocalc.com/) or Jupyter, to work and
collaborate with each other.

At the end of the year there is an open-house event where discoveries can be
showcased and any results presented. Finally, a written report is prepared by
the project members as a record of their work.


#### The Axioms of XML
The VXML strongly believes in [Federico Ardila-Mantillaâ€™s
axioms <i class="fa-solid fa-file-pdf"></i>](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/Articles/noticesfinal.pdf):

  * **Axiom 1**: Mathematical talent is distributed equally among different
    groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
  * **Axiom 2**: Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering
    mathematical experiences.
  * **Axiom 3**: Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped
    and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
  * **Axiom 4**: Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
