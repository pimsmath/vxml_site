## Problem Statement

We will work on large-scale genomic data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative Study, where we have millions of genotype variables and
multiple cognitive outcomes, as well as information regarding participants'
demographical characteristics and social-economic status.

Based on such a rich information source, we would like to work on two aims: (1)
to build a machine learning model for simultaneous prediction of multiple
cognitive outcomes; (2) to identify gene pathways linked to participants'
cognitive functions. To realize Aim 1, we will extend our previous research
output (a peer-review publication on Bioinformatics and an R package/software on
CRAN) to make the model accommodate data of much higher dimensions. To realize
Aim 2, we will employ all sorts of gene network analysis toolkits to determine
the associated pathway of the identified important genes from the prediction
model.

Our work is fascinating and also highly important. Students will need to learn
cloud computation and manage large-scale genomic data, which are not covered by
regular courses but are essential in analyzing real-world data. They need to
work together with a group containing students with different expertise. They
are expected to share their knowledge and brainstorm new ideas to solve
difficulties. Those technical and soft skills will help them grow into data
scientists. The research outputs will help diagnose and prevent diseases related
to cognitive functions, such as Alzheimer's.
