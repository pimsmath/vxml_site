## Problem Statement

This project develops a fundamental tool for representation theory of p-adic
groups: computing multiplicity matrices for admissible representations.

Representations of Lie groups play a central role in areas of research ranging
from high-energy physics to number theory. In 2008, the [Atlas for Lie Groups and
Representations](http://atlas.math.umd.edu/) was fÃªted in Science, Nature,
Scientific American and the New York Times for computing the multiplicity matrix
for the exceptional Lie group $E_8$. At the heart of the $E_8$ result is a tool that
responds to this query: find the change of basis matrix relating irreducible
representations and standard representations in the Grothendieck group of
smooth representations. In fact, the Atlas tool answers this query for Lie
groups of all types. This project develops a tool that answers the same
query for p-adic groups. Lie groups and p-adic groups are parallel
structures that appear together in the Langlands program. In fact, one can
effectively argue that studying Lie groups without p-adic groups is like
listening to the sound of one hand clapping. This project is the first step
in building the hand that matches the Atlas: we call it the p-Atlas. The
idea of building an Atlas for p-adic Groups and Representations, or p-Atlas
as we call it, was born in the early days of the [Voganish
Project](http://automorphic.ca/). This idea is now viable because of
developments in the Voganish Project in Summer 2022, resulting in algorithms
that compute multiplicity matrices for three infinite families of
representations of p-adic $GL(n)$. With this project, we will expand that
capability significantly. The Voganish Project is a vibrant, diverse,
international, vertically integrated research group with faculty in Canada, USA,
France, Korea and China. The PIMS XVMLab format is a perfect fit for this
community, to recruit and expand and to develop new computational tools for the
Langlands program.

### Details
  * Expected team size: 3
  * Student Experience Level: Intermediate, students who have had an
    introduction to proofs
##### Prerequisites
  * Advanced Linear Algebra
  * Multivariate Calculus
  * Abstract Algebra
##### Skills
  * Python/Sage
  * GitHub (preferred)
  * LaTeX (optional)


### Other Information
The objective of this project is to develop and implement algorithms to compute
multiplicity matrices for multiple infinite families of representations of
p-adic GL(n) building on geometric techniques we have developed and implemented
for other families. All students working on this PIMS VXML project will be
members of the Voganish Project (http://automorphic.ca) and therefore have
access and exposure to an international research community already including
undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs and professors.
