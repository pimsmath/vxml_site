  Topological Data Analysis (TDA) applies classical methods of algebraic

## Problem Statement

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) applies classical methods of algebraic topology
to investigate and make inferences about the topology of (possibly
large/complex) data sets. Still in its infancy, TDA has already been applied
successfully to numerous areas of scientific research. In this project,
participants will learn and apply current tools and techniques of TDA to objects
of current interest at the interface of geometry, topology, and physics, such as
the various moduli spaces investigated across several areas of mathematics
research.

Understanding the geometry and topology of moduli spaces can be difficult; in
some cases, even determining whether a moduli space is connected — a topological
feature whereby the space consists of a single geometric/contiguous ‘piece’ —
can be challenging. The methods of TDA, such as persistent homology, can be
applied to a random sampling of data (points) from the moduli space (suitably
embedded in Euclidean space) to give insights on the presence (or absence) of
such topological features in the moduli space, helping guide further research in
the subject.

Students working on this project will learn the fundamentals of topological data
analysis while enhance their understanding of topology and geometry as
mathematical subjects in general. Students will also encounter, for instance,
aspects of linear algebra and other core courses that are less emphasized in
traditional undergraduate course offerings.
