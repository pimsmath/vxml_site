#summary: |
#  In this project, students will develop techniques from knot theory and
#  combinatorics to address questions about the geometry and topology of
#  3-stranded polymers such as R-loops. An R-loop is a 3 stranded structure
#  composed of a DNA-RNA complex and another single strand of DNA.

## Problem Statement
The Smith Normal Forms (SNF) of an incidence matrix is a powerful invariant that
may help distinguish the underlying incidence structure. Of special interest is
the SNF of the Laplacian matrix of a graph. This comes up in the context of the
popular chip-firing game. This game was introduced by Bjorner et al. Fix a graph
on n vertices and start by putting chips $a\left\{i\right\}$ at the $i$th
vertex. So $a=(a\left{1\right\}, ...
a\left\{i\right\}, ... , a\left\{n\right\}) is in Z_\left\{+\right\}^{n}, let N
be the sum of $a\left\{i\right\}'s. Each step
involves firing a vertex v, that is, one chip from $v$ goes to each of its
adjacent vertices. A vertex $v$ can be fired if the number of chips currently held
at $v$ is at least the degree of $v$. A position of size $N$ on $G$ is a distribution of
$N$ chips to vertices of $G$. A legal game is any sequence of positions, such that
each position is obtained from the previous one by firing at a vertex of $G$.
Bjorner et al proved that given a connected graph, with an initial distribution
of chips, either every legal game can be continued indefinitely, or terminated
after the same number of steps and final position. Biggs introduced a variant of
this game in which a vertex $q$ can have a negative number of chips, in fact, we
need $q$ to always be in "debt". A configuration on $G$ is a distribution of $s(j)$
chips at every vertex jâ‰ q, and s(q)=-sum s(j) chips at q. Biggs proved that any
starting configuration of a graph $G$ leads to a unique critical configuration,
and the set of critical configurations has a natural group operation that is
isomorphic to the critical group $K(G)$.

Potential research plan: Literature indicates that the class of Strongly regular
graphs (SRG) has been amenable to the computation of critical groups. There have
been many papers computing the critical groups of various classes of SRGs. Quite
a few of these have been coauthored by undergraduate researchers. Participating
in this program will be encouraged to pick a class of SRGs and perform computer
experiments to conjecture the structure of critical group
