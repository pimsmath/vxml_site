summary: |
  This project will look at a variant of "Pólya's orchard problem". You will
  use simulation and probability to determine lines of sight in a mathematical
  model of an orchard with apple trees distributed in various ways.

## Problem Statement

Suppose you are standing at the centre of an infinite, two-dimensional apple
orchard: you are at the origin $(0,0)$, and at every integer lattice point $(m, n)$
other than $(0, 0)$ there is a circular tree of radius $r$. You can turn and look in
any direction, and depending on where you look, you might be looking directly at
a tree, or you might be able to see infinitely far. We will start by discussing
the classical question 'Can you see infinitely far?', known in the literature as
''Pólyas orchard problem.' This version is well-studied, including results
related to: which direction gives you the longest line of sight, how far you can
see as a function of $r$, trees of different shapes, and other underlying lattices
or dimensions. A natural variant is to place trees according to a Poisson point
process (i.e. 'uniformly randomly') instead of at the integer lattice points. We
will try to answer the same questions for this model. Computer simulation will
be a useful tool. A bit of probability and coding background will be helpful,
but is not necessary.
