## Problem Statement

The multiplicative order of a fixed integer a modulo the prime p must divide
p–1. Artin's conjecture proposes an asymptotic formula for the number of primes
for which this order equals p–1 exactly.  However, one can ask for more than a
yes/no answer: one can compare how close the order is to being p–1, by
counting the number of prime factors of their quotient, for example.  We
have work in progress (with Leo Goldmakher) generalizing Artin's conjecture
to the more detailed study of this measure of closeness. In this project,
students will carry out computations for lots of integers a and primes p,
gathering data on the number of prime factors of (p–1 divided by the order
of a modulo p).  These computations can then be compared to our theoretical
predictions of the relative frequencies. That comparison itself requires
some work, as the predictions come in the form of a generating function that
is an infinite product over primes (whose constant term is the proportion
predicted in Artin's conjecture). Students will also learn how to extract
the relative frequencies from this generating function, as well as how to
compute the resulting expressions to high precision.
