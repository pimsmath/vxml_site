  In this project, students will develop techniques from knot theory and
  combinatorics to address questions about the geometry and topology of
  3-stranded polymers such as R-loops. An R-loop is a 3 stranded structure
  composed of a DNA-RNA complex and another single strand of DNA.

## Problem Statement

DNA and RNA contain the genetic code of life. They typically occur in the form
of long polymers that are subjected to high levels of confinement. During
cellular processes, modifications of the geometry and topology of DNA and RNA
can yield multi-stranded structures such as R-loops. An R-loop is a 3-stranded
structure composed of an RNA-DNA complex and another single strand of DNA.
Experimental studies indicate that R-loops can play either destructive or
regulatory roles in cellular processes. Thus, it is important to determine the
factors influencing R-loop formation and stability. It is known that both DNA
sequence and topology affect R-loop formation, however, little is known about
their topological entanglement.

We propose to use techniques from knot theory and combinatorics to address
questions about the geometry and topology of 3-stranded polymers such as
R-loops. Ferrari and coworkers are developing a sequence-dependent method for
predicting the location of R-loops based on a formal grammar model. Given a DNA
sequence, the model can be applied to predict the probabilities of R-loop
formation along the sequence. One aspect of the proposed project will be to
computationally explore the behaviour of this formal grammar model on a variety
of DNA sequences. This can be used, for example, to obtain information about the
lengths of R-loop regions. However this approach does not predict the nature of
entanglements that can occur. In order to address questions about entanglement
complexity, a lattice model of 3-stranded polymers under confinement will be
used. Soteros and coworkers have used such models to characterize the
entanglement complexity of 2-stranded and 4-stranded polymers confined to a
lattice tube using transfer matrix methods. These approaches will be adapted to
address the 3-stranded case in this project. The ultimate goal will be to
integrate the different mathematical approaches of the mentors to obtain
improved mathematical models of R-loops.
