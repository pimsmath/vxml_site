  In this project, students will look at the subspaces preserved by matrices.
  This has applications in linear algebra, control theory and statistical
  inference and is also theoretically significant.

## Problem Statement

One of the most fundamental problems in linear algebra is that of finding the
eigenvectors of a given matrix. We can vastly generalize this problem by asking
to find all subspaces which are preserved by the matrix. This more general
problem is relevant to several applications of linear algebra, such as control
theory and statistical inference, and is also theoretically significant. In
spite of its apparent simplicity, there are related geometric and algebraic
questions which are less well understood. One example which can be probed with
computational tools is the question of giving a complete list of algebraic
equations encoding the above problem, over a field of arbitrary characteristic
-- a question with surprising ties to the combinatorics of higher level Fock
spaces in conformal field theory and to the topology of certain moduli spaces.

Putting aside the applications, the central problem itself only requires a
working knowledge of linear algebra. Students involved in the project will
sharpen their understanding of linear algebra and become adept at computations
that are less explored in typical undergraduate linear algebra classes.
