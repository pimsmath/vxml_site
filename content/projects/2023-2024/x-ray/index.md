## Problem Statement
Let $K$ be a convex body in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, that is, a compact
convex set with non-empty interior. Let $L$ be a line through the origin. We say
that the point $p$ of $K$ is X-rayed along $L$ if the line parallel to $L$
passing through $p$ intersects the interior of $K$. The X-ray number of $K$ is
the smallest number of lines through the origin such that every point of $K$ is
X-rayed along at least one of these lines.

In 1994, Bezdek and Zamfirescu published the conjecture – often called the X-ray
Conjecture – that the X-ray number of any convex body in $d$-dimensional
Euclidean space is at most $3.2^{d-2}$. The X-ray conjecture is proved in the
plane and it is open in any dimension higher. Here we propose to investigate the
following problem, which is strongly connected to the X-ray conjecture. In order
to state it we need to recall the following concepts from the theory of convex
polytopes.  The convex polytope $P$ is called weakly neighborly if any two
vertices of $P$ lie on a face of $P$. Furthermore, the convex polytope $P$ is
called antipodal if any two vertices of $P$ lie on parallel supporting
hyperplanes of $P$. Conjecture [Bezdek and Kiss (2009)]. If $P$ is an arbitrary
$d$-dimensional weakly neighborly antipodal convex polytope, then the number of
vertices of $P$ is at most $3(2^{d-2})$ for all $d>2$.

If the above conjecture holds, then it proves the X-ray conjecture for the
family of weakly neighborly antipodal convex polytopes (and the upper bound is
sharp). On the other hand, if it fails, then it generates a counter-example to
the X-ray Conjecture. Thus, it would be very timely to prove or disprove the
Bezdek-Kiss Conjecture. In fact, in dimensions 3 and 4, one would expect a
computational approach by characterizing, that is, listing the different
combinatorial (resp., geometric) types of weakly neighborly antipodal convex
polytopes. Hence, one is left with checking the Bezdek-Kiss conjecture for those
specific combinatorial-geometric classes of convex polytopes.
