  In this project, students will develop techniques from knot theory and
  combinatorics to address questions about the geometry and topology of
  3-stranded polymers such as R-loops. An R-loop is a 3 stranded structure
  composed of a DNA-RNA complex and another single strand of DNA.

## Problem Statement

DNA and RNA contain the genetic code of life. They typically occur in the form
of long polymers that are subjected to high levels of confinement. During
cellular processes, modifications of the geometry and topology of DNA and RNA
can yield multi-stranded structures such as R-loops. An R-loop is a 3-stranded
structure composed of an RNA-DNA complex and another single strand of DNA.
Experimental studies indicate that R-loops can play either destructive or
regulatory roles in cellular processes. Thus, it is important to determine the
factors influencing R-loop formation and stability. It is known that both DNA
sequence and topology affect R-loop formation, however, little is known about
their topological entanglement.

We propose to continue a [VXML project started last
year](/projects/2022-2023/combinatorics/) and use techniques from knot theory
and combinatorics to address questions about the geometry and topology of
3-stranded polymers such as R-loops. Ferrari and coworkers have developed a
sequence-dependent method for predicting the location of R-loops based on a
formal grammar model. Given a DNA sequence, the model can be applied to predict
the probabilities of R-loop formation along the sequence. Last year the team
used some preliminary information from the formal grammar model to explore two
simplified Markov chain models of R-loops: one model for R-loop formation and
the other for R-loop geometry. The geometry model however was not 3-dimensional
and hence could not be used to predict the nature of entanglements that can
occur. In order to address questions about entanglement complexity, this year a
3-d lattice model of 3-stranded polymers under confinement will be used. The
improved model will also include sequence-dependent information derived from the
formal grammar model. The ultimate goal will be to integrate the different
mathematical approaches of the mentors to obtain improved mathematical models of
R-loops.
