## Problem Statement

The multiplicative order of a fixed integer a modulo the prime p must divide
p–1. Artin's conjecture proposes an asymptotic formula for the number of primes
for which this order equals p–1 exactly. However, one can ask for more than a
yes/no answer, by comparing how close the order is to being p–1, by counting
the number of prime factors of their quotient, for example. We have work in
progress (with Leo Goldmakher) generalizing Artin's conjecture to the more
detailed study of this measure of closeness. In this project, students will
carry out computations for lots of integers a and primes p, gathering data
on the number of prime factors of (p–1 divided by the order of a modulo p).
These computations can then be compared to our theoretical predictions of
the relative frequencies. That comparison itself requires some work, as the
predictions come in the form of a generating function that is an infinite
product over primes (whose constant term is the proportion predicted in
Artin's conjecture). Students will also learn how to extract the relative
frequencies from this generating function, as well as how to compute the
resulting expressions to high precision.
